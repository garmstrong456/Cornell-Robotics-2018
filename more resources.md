# Where to go from here
I've compiled some resources to help you explore the world of Arduino, robotics, electronics and engineering. If you're wondering what you can do with the kits you're taking home check out some of these links.

## Idea7 and the Bambot
The robot [kits](https://idea7.cc/product/fabricating-the-future-robot-kit/) you used were designed specially for this class by [Idea7](https://idea7.cc). Idea7 is small company committed to developing educational tools to help inspire a new generation of makers and entrepenours. Keep an eye on their website for more exciting content, kits and ventures.  

If you want more information about the kits and whats inside them, check out this bill of materials. It's a (mostly) complete list of all the parts in your kit. It also has links on where to buy extra parts, documentation and programming resources.

## Arduino
There are an almost endless number of projects you can do with an Arduino and a basic knowledge of electronics. If you need inspiration check out these links

## Materials
Have an idea for an awesome project? Need to find a place to buy parts or raw materials? These are some of my go-to sources for the stuff that goes in my projects.

#### Adafruit
www.adafruit.com  
Founded by [Limor "Ladyada" Fried](https://www.adafruit.com/about) in 2005, Adafruit is all about providing electronics for makers of all skill levels. They stock useful components as well as high quality, in-house designed and manufactured electronics. Their tutorials, code and customer support are also some of the best out there. The PWM Driver board is an Adafruit product and many of the Arduino libraries we used were written by Adafruit.

#### Sparkfun
www.sparkfun.com  
Similar to Adafruit. They tend to have slightly different products in stock so its worth checking both sites.

#### Pololu
www.pololu.com  
Another website for hobbyist electronics and makers. Pololu tends to specialize more in robotics than Arduino. They've got a great selection of motors and actuators.

#### General Electronics Components
www.digikey.com  
www.newark.com  
www.jameco.com  
www.mouser.com  
Between these four websites you can probably find every electronics component available today. Digikey lists over 700,000 types of resistors alone. Navigating these sites can be intimidating, but learning how to read through datasheets and find the right component is an invaluable skill.

## Custom Fabrication

#### Makerspaces
[Makerspaces](https://www.makerspaces.com/what-is-a-makerspace/) are what inspired me to get into robotics and electronics. If you need help with a project, space or tools to work, or just a place to find like minded engineers and hackers look for a Makerspace in your area.  

Makerspaces often have cool digital manufacturing tools like 3D printers, laser cutters and CNC routers available to the general public. If you weren't able to get your fill of 3D printing with this class look for one in your area.

#### Online Fabrication Services
www.shapeways.com
www.ponoko.com
These websites will take your CAD files and turn them into actual parts. Prices vary depending on the size, complexity and material you need. It's not as practical as having direct access to a 3D printer or laser cutter, but its better than nothing.
